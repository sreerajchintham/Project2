### TIME SPENT :
 We worked a total of 30 hours on this project but were unable to complete it. We were trapped in an unending circle of failures and problems, and time was running short. The issue was how we processed the information. Our parser was a one-line parser, which reads one line at a time and forgets the previous one when it comes to the next. It was too late by the time we realized this.
 
### DESCRIPTION :
We tested a few manual inputs with bare expression and obtained the desired results. We also utilized input to test variables; we finished addition and subtraction but were unable to complete the print keyword. But, after we saw the flaw in our approach to this code, there was nothing we could do.
 
### BUGS and ISSUES :
 There have been several mistakes and problems. One of the major issues was our approach to the project. We wrote a one-line parser that takes one line at a time and forgets the previous line when it gets to the next. It was too late by the time we realized we were on the wrong track and attempted to restart.
It's not our greatest effort, and it may be one of our worst.
