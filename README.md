### TIME SPENT :
 We worked a total of 30 hours on this project but we could not complete the project. We were stuck in an endless loop of errors and issues and the time run out. The problem was the way we took the input. Our parser was a one line parser which reads one line at a time and when it gets to the next line it forgets the previous one. By the time we realised this it was too late. 

### DESCRIPTION :
 We tested a few manual inputs using bare expression with which we were able to get the expected outputs. We used input to check variables too, we completed the addition and subtration though we could not complete the print keyword. But after we realised the issue with our way of approach for this code, We could not do much.
 
### BUGS and ISSUES :
 There have been alot of errors and Issues. One of the main Issue was the our way of approach to the project. We coded a one line parser which take a single line at a time and when it gets to the next line it forgets the previous line. By the time we realise we are on the wrong approach and tried to start anew it was already too late.
 It's not our best work,it may be one of our worst works.
